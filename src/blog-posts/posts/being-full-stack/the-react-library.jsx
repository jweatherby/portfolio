      React is my frontend library of choice. I've spent a few years learning
      its nuances and it's incredibly powerful. With its maturity over the past
      couple years and the tooling getting first class support, I'll likely
      default to React when starting a new project.

      I know it's healthy to expand your toolkit, but it's also important to
      know specific tools very well to work quickly and effectively. To me,
      React accomplishes that. There are other excellent frameworks / JS
      languages, like Elm, ClojureScript, Svelte, Angular and VueJs and they all
      have their advantages and surrounding community; but, I do not have the
      time to possibly learn all these different languages. You have to pick
      your battles and your toolkit, and I choose React.
