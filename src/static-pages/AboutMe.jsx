      <article>
        <p>Hi, I'm Jamie.</p>
        <p>
          I've been a Software Engineer for 10 years, focusing primarily on
          Python and JavaScript. I am a principled engineer, am very
          enthusiastic about functional programming, and am always introspecting
          on how systems can be improved. I strive to make my code readable,
          correct and fast, in that order.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently working for{' '}

            Points
          </a>
          , a great company with a strong focus on culture, engineering and work
          life balance. Outside of work, I play a lot of sports and boardgames.
